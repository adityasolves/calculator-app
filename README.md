# Basic Calculator

This is a basic calculator project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes:

- A user-friendly interface with buttons for digits and arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
- Special functions like:
  - `AC` (clear the display)
  - `DE` (delete the last character)
  - `=` (evaluate the expression)
- The calculator displays the result of the mathematical expression entered via the buttons.
- JavaScript handles the logic for appending values, performing calculations, and clearing or modifying inputs.
